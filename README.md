There are many papers out there on the effect of non-linearities originating from soil and/or hydrodynamic loading of subsea pipelines but much less on the non-linear behaviour of the steucture itself (e.g. when the piepline has coupled large lateral/trasversal deformation or when it behaves like a Duffing oscillator). These are the main additions of this paper. Most of the scripts used for analysis are included here.
