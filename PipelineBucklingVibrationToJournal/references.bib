@article{Bokaian:1990tk,
	abstract = {The effect of a constant axial tensile force on natural frequencies and mode shapes of a uniform single-span beam, with different combinations of end conditions, is presented. Numerical observations indicate that the variation of normalized natural frequency parameter, Ω−, with normalized tension parameter, Ω−, is almost the same for clamped-pinned and pinned-free, and similarly for clamped-clamped and clamped-sliding beams; the variation of the sliding-free beam is only slightly different from that of the latter pair and the free-free beam. For pinned-pinned, pinned-sliding and sliding-sliding beams, this variation may exactly be expressed as Ω−= √1 + U−. This formula may be used for beams with other types of end constraints when the beam vibrates in a third mode or higher. It also gives the upper bound approximation to the fundamental natural frequency of a pinned-free beam. For beams with other types of boundary conditions, this approximation may be expressed as Ω−= √1 + γU−(γ< 1), where the coefficient γdepends only on the type of the end constraints. It is found that when the dimensionless tension parameter U is greater than about 12, then U can be expressed as an analytical function of ΩU, where Ωis the dimensionless natural frequency parameter. For such a beam in the first few modes, the natural frequency is independent of the flexural rigidity and the beam behaves like a string. The string solution gives a lower bound approximation to the natural frequency.},

@article{Antonio:2012tm,
	abstract = {Mechanical oscillators are present in almost every electronic device. They mainly consist of a resonating element providing an oscillating output with a specific frequency. Their ability to maintain a determined frequency in a specified period of time is the most important parameter limiting their implementation. Historically, quartz crystals have almost exclusively been used as the resonating element, but micromechanical resonators are increasingly being considered to replace them. These resonators are easier to miniaturize and allow for monolithic integration with electronics. However, as their dimensions shrink to the microscale, most mechanical resonators exhibit nonlinearities that considerably degrade the frequency stability of the oscillator. Here we demonstrate that, by coupling two different vibrational modes through an internal resonance, it is possible to stabilize the oscillation frequency of nonlinear self-sustaining micromechanical resonators. Our findings provide a new strategy for engineering low-frequency noise oscillators capitalizing on the intrinsic nonlinear phenomena of micromechanical resonators.},

	abstract = {The Duffing oscillator is probably the most popular example of a nonlinear oscillator in dynamics. Considering the case of softening Duffing oscillator with weak damping and harmonic excitation and performing standard methods like harmonic balance or perturbation analysis, zero mean solutions with large amplitudes are found for small excitation frequencies. These solutions produce a ''nose-like''curve in the amplitude--frequency diagram and merge with the inclining resonance curve for decreasing (but non-vanishing) damping. These results are presented without any additional discussion in several textbooks. The present paper discusses the accurateness of these solutions by introducing an error estimation in the harmonic balance method showing large errors. Performing a modified perturbation analysis leads to solutions with non-vanishing mean value, showing very small errors in the harmonic balance error analysis.},

	abstract = {We present an exact solution for the postbuckling configurations of beams with fixed--fixed, fixed--hinged, and hinged--hinged boundary conditions. We take into account the geometric nonlinearity arising from midplane stretching, and as a result, the governing equation exhibits a cubic nonlinearity. We solve the nonlinear buckling problem and obtain a closed-form solution for the postbuckling configurations in terms of the applied axial load. The critical buckling loads and their associated mode shapes, which are the only outcome of solving the linear buckling problem, are obtained as a byproduct. We investigate the dynamic stability of the obtained postbuckling configurations and find out that the first buckled shape is a stable equilibrium position for all boundary conditions. However, we find out that buckled configurations beyond the first buckling mode are unstable equilibrium positions. We present the natural frequencies of the lowest vibration modes around each of the first three buckled configurations. The results show that many internal resonances might be activated among the vibration modes around the same as well as different buckled configurations. We present preliminary results of the dynamic response of a fixed--fixed beam in the case of a one-to-one internal resonance between the first vibration mode around the first buckled configuration and the first vibration mode around the second buckled configuration.},

	abstract = {Natural frequencies, mode shapes and modal damping ratios must be estimated to assess subsea pipeline spans for vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and response to direct wave loading. Several approximate solutions exist for a linearly elastic pipe under constant axial force supported by linearly elastic springs beyond the span's shoulders. An exact analytical solution has only recently been published. That solution is used here in a Rayleigh-Ritz approximation to account for arch action arising from combined effects of sag under gravity loads and axial restraint at the shoulders. The method allows survey data to be used directly to quantify arch action. Its accuracy is confirmed by finite element analysis. Further, the modal damping ratio is estimated based on the fractions of the potential energy in bending, the axial force, and the soil springs, all of which are determined analytically. Thus, it is found that the effective modal damping ratio increases without a bound as the axial load approaches the buckling load in compression.},

@article{Wang:2009ui,
	abstract = {Spans occur when a pipeline is laid on a rough undulating seabed or when upheaval buckling occurs due to constrained thermal expansion. This not only results in static and dynamic loads on the flowline at span sections, but also generates vortex induced vibration (VIV), which can lead to fatigue issues. The phenomenon, if not predicted and controlled properly, will negatively affect pipeline integrity, leading to expensive remediation and intervention work. Span analysis can be complicated by: long span lengths, a large number of spans caused by a rough seabed, and multi-span interactions. In addition, the complexity can be more onerous and challenging when soil uncertainty, concrete degradation and unknown residual lay tension are considered in the analysis. This paper describes the latest developments and a `state-of-the-art'finite element analysis program that has been developed to simulate the span response of a flowline under complex boundary and loading conditions. Both VIV and direct wave loading are captured in the analysis and the results are sequentially used for the ultimate limit state (ULS) check and fatigue life calculation.},

	n2 = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the method for describing the dynamic structural response of a pipeline under vortex-induced vibration. Both the conventional single span model with simple boundary conditions, and a three-dimensional multispan model representing a pipeline on an uneven seabed are considered. Particular attention is given to the sensitivity to variables affecting the predicted span behaviour such as end conditions, effective force, soil-pipe interface and span interaction. Comparison between single span and multispan results reveal that the single span analysis method is not always conservative and the natural frequency is as dependent on effective force and axial restraint as it is on span length.Free-spans will be present when pipelines are installed on an uneven seabed or will develop by erosion of the supporting seabed, see fig. 1a. If the pipeline is exposed to wave or current forces the unsupported pipe span is susceptible to vortex induced vibrations (VIV). As the dynamic excitations of the free-span may cause fatigue damage at the welds, it is important to be able to identify spans that needs to be corrected through seabed intervention. This assessment is an important part of pipeline design. The VIV assessment basically consists of two components; a hydrodynamic part and a structural response part. VIV occurs when the hydrodynamic excitation frequency is within a certain range that coincides with the natural frequency of the span. The phenomena of fluid flow past a solid body causing VIV is of relevance to many engineering applications. The fluid dynamic mechanism causing VIV have been extensively researched and documented. Comprehensive overviews of pipeline VIV methodology and experiments are given by Sumer (1994), King (1977), Vandiver (1993) and Pantazopoulos (1994). Recently a new design guideline for free spanning pipelines have been issued by DNV (1997).},

	abstract = {On-bottom stability design of subsea pipelines transporting hydrocarbons is important to ensure safety and reliability but is challenging to achieve in the onerous metocean (meteorological and oceanographic) conditions typical of large storms (such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes or typhoons). This challenge is increased by the fact that industry design guidelines presently give no guidance on how to incorporate the potential benefits of seabed mobility, which can lead to lowering and self-burial of the pipeline on a sandy seabed. In this paper, we demonstrate recent advances in experimental modelling of pipeline scour and present results investigating how pipeline stability can change in a large storm. An emphasis is placed on the initial development of the storm, where scour is inevitable on an erodible bed as the storm velocities build up to peak conditions. During this initial development, we compare the rate at which peak near-bed velocities increase in a large storm (typically less than 10(-3) m s(-2)) to the rate at which a pipeline scours and subsequently lowers (which is dependent not only on the storm velocities, but also on the mechanism of lowering and the pipeline properties). We show that the relative magnitude of these rates influences pipeline embedment during a storm and the stability of the pipeline.},

The effect of lee‐wake of the pipe is the key element in the scour process, and it is demonstrated that the Keulegan‐Carpenter number is the main parameter that governs the equilibrium scour depth. Based on the presently available data, a design equation is established, relating the equilibrium scour depth to the Keulegan‐Carpenter number for the live‐bed situation and for a pipe in contact with the bed. The latter equation indicates that the equilibrium scour depth normalized with the pipe diameter is proportional to the square root of the Keulegan‐Carpenter number, the proportionality constant being 0.1. The effect of Shields parameter on the final scour depth is found to be quite weak. It is also found that the surface roughness of the pipe imposes practically no influence on the scour process. The pipe position with respect to the bed appears to be an important parameter in determining the equilibrium scour depth.},

@article{Fredsoe:1992aa,
	abstract = {A non-dimensional formula has been developed for the time scale of the scour process below a marine pipeline, based on the presently available data. The main past of the data originates from ISVA. Both the current case and the pure-wave case are considered. The results indicate that the non-dimensional time scale is proportional to the −5/3 power of the Shields parameter. In the study, the time scale of scour, involving a change in the wave climate, has also been investigated. The results indicate that the time scale is governed by the Shields parameter plus the two Keulegan-Carpenter numbers corresponding to the waves before and after the change takes place.When a pipeline is laid on an originally plane bed, scour will take place below the pipeline due to the action of waves and current, where the scour process will eventually attain a fully developed stage. The scour depth corresponding to this fully developed stage has been studied quite extensively for steady currents - Kjeldsen et al. (1973), Bijker and Leeuwestein (1984) and Mao (1986), among others, for a fixed pipe, and Sumer et al. (1988) and Kristiansen (1988) for a vibrating pipe - and more recently for waves - Sumer and Freds{\o}e (1990). The purpose of the present study is to investigate the time scale of the scour process. The study covers also the transitional scour processes involving changes in wave climate.However, the data indicate that the dependence on the Shields parameter is quite weak (when the scour takes place on a live bed), while the dependence on the relative roughness and Re number is insignificant. See Sumer and Freds{\o}e (1990), which collected the data from Kjeldsen et al. (1973), Lucassen (1984), Mao (1986) and Kristiansen (1988). %[ 5/29/2022},

	abstract = {A pipeline laid on an erodible sandy seabottom introduces a local disturbance in the wave/current flow that could cause the onset of scouring underneath the pipe itself. This could lead to a pipe self-lowering and/or to free spans formation and evolution. The investigation of the evolution of the pipe/seabottom configuration has significant relevancies for pipeline design as the action of waves and current might cause the vibration of unsupported sections of the pipeline and the accumulation of unacceptable fatigue damage. Therefore, a reliable design approach needs to estimate the evolutions of the pipe-seabed configuration in the first years after pipe laying, to identify the possible hazardous scenarios and to plan adequate corrective actions or pipeline inspection strategy. Numerous experimental investigations have been carried out to determine the critical conditions for onset of scouring and free-span development. These have led to the formulation of empirical relations between forcing agents (waves and current) and the relevant physical phenomena. Based on such formulas, a numerical model (PIPESOIL) for the time evolution of the pipe-soil configuration has been developed. In parallel, a numerical model (SPAFAT) for the fatigue analysis of free spans subjected to vortex induced vibrations and direct wave actions has been developed. The two models (PIPESOIL and SPAFAT) have been coupled in order to evaluate the fatigue damage that an evolving free span could accumulate under the same environmental conditions (waves and current) that are driving its evolution. Descriptions of the models, of their application and of typical results are presented in this paper.A pipeline laid on the sea-bottom introduces a local disturbance in the wave/current flow. When the flow impacts on the pipeline a pressure gradient is established between the upstream and downstream sides of the obstacle. If the sea-bottom is permeable, i.e. it is a sandy seabottom, such pressure gradient drives a seepage flow in the bottom on which the pipe is laid. %[ 5/29/2022},

@article{Bi:2016aa,
	abstract = {Pipe-in-pipe (PIP) systems are increasingly used in subsea pipeline applications due to their favourable thermal insulation capacity. Pipe-in-pipe systems consist of concentric inner and outer pipes, the inner pipe carries hydrocarbons and the outer pipe provides mechanical protection to withstand the external hydrostatic pressure. The annulus between the inner and outer pipes is either empty or filled with non-structural insulation material. Due to the special structural layout, optimized springs and dashpots can be installed in the annulus and the system can be made as a structure-tuned mass damper (TMD) system, which therefore has the potential to mitigate the pipeline vibrations induced by various sources. This paper proposes using pipe-in-pipe systems for the subsea pipeline vibration control. The simplification of the pipe-in-pipe system as a non-conventional structure-TMD system is firstly presented. The effectiveness of using pipe-in-pipe system to mitigate seismic induced vibration of a subsea pipeline with a free span is investigated through numerical simulations by examining the seismic responses of both the traditional and proposed pipe-in-pipe systems based on the detailed three dimensional (3D) numerical analyses. Two possible design options and the robustness of the proposed system for the pipeline vibration control are discussed. Numerical results show that the proposed pipe-in-pipe system can effectively suppress seismic induced vibrations of subsea pipelines without changing too much of the traditional design. Therefore it could be a cost-effective solution to mitigate pipe vibrations subjected to external dynamic loadings.},

Explicit analytical formulae for the modal response quantities are derived, with improved accuracy and applicability range as compared to approximate expressions that are widely used in the pipeline industry today.},

	abstract = {Very short pipeline free spans in flooded areas, river crossings, straits and inlets have been given a lot of attention due to recent failures caused by vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). Performing VIV analyses of free spanning pipelines requires accurate prediction of modal response quantities. Currently, no simple analytical solutions are available for short free spans supported by soils with a finite stiffness. Based on the Buckingham Pi theorem, the solution space for short free spans is spanned in the present study. Closed form analytical solutions are determined based on surface fitting to the developed solution space. The novel analytical solutions are accurate, easily implementable and thoroughly verified, and represent a significant improvement to current approaches found in design standards. An accurate expression for the buckling load of short spans is also derived, and asymptotic properties of the buckling load and frequency equations as the span length approaches zero are explored.},
